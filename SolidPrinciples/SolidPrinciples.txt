Summary:

SOLID Principles:
	 Design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 
	 These principles help developers create systems that are easy to scale, test, and modify without introducing unintended side effects.

	 Advatages of following Solid principles:
		- Improves Maintainability
		- Facilitates Testing
		- Promotes Reusability
		- Reduces Coupling
		
		- Incase of introducing new features to an application. The new developer doesnt need to be completely aware of the entire system, inorder to introduce a
		new functionality or feature. Since everything will be decoupled and follow a strict principles.

Single Responsibility Principle:
	- Everything in that class should be related to a single purpose.
	- There may be many members/methods in class as long as they relate to a single responsibility.

Open Close Principle:
	- A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	- Here Extension is can have newly created methods which can serve new purpose, at the same time the existing implementation should not be modified.


Interface Segregation Principle:
	- A class should only implement an interface if it actually needs and uses the methods defined in it.
	- Instead of having one big interface with many methods, break it into smaller, more specific ones.
