Things to consider:
    - This should give overview and indepth understanding of concepts and possibly can help others too.

SQL:
    - Simple to create in a new machine.
    - Easy update the data while learning
    Sol 1:
        - Excel file should have the data,So each table will be there in different sheet
            - SheetName = TableName
            - 1st Col = ColumnName
            - Rest = Rows
        - Single Load Function in Python will do
            - SQL Create script to create the table, Which will execute by Python to create those tables
            - From Excel load those tables 
        
        - Folder wise SQL files
